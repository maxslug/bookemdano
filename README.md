# bookemdano
A small tool to look up ISBN numbers and create a CSV file from a list of book suggestions.  For Goodreads

This tool will take in a list of vague book searches, one by line and then
use Python's isbnlib to search for a target match.  It's not perfect, but pretty good!

The output is a CSV file that you can then use in Excel or import into things like Goodreads.
